# BFC | Brainfuck Compiler
A simple brainf$%k compiler made with C++, and C libs.

## Usage
Edit code.bf file shipped with bfc.exe, or create a new file.
Create brainfuck code. Once you are finished, open command prompt and write this command:
```
./bfc.exe <file>
```
In place of <filepath>, insert the filepath for your file, for example
```
./bfc.exe code.bf
```
This will run the program, and show it's output to the command prompt. Once its finished, the process stops, and you can use your terminal once again.
